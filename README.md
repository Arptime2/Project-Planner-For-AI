# Project Planner For AI

## General Idea
- All vanilla html, css and js
- Really visually appealing
- Should work both on mobile and on pc and also work the same (no double finger gestures and no scroll weel or right click)


- One tab for planning file and folder structure in a tree structure like also the actual project planning (in an own folder)
- One tab to see all the prompts one after the other and have a small button to copy each one at a time (in an own folder)
- One tab to plan the actual project in a tree structure to plan every smallest feature with a section where you can write down just ideas that will come somewhere into the tree but you don't know where yet (in an own folder)

- One tab to create a new project/ open existing project plans (main.html)
